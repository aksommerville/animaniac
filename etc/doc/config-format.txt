Animaniac config file format.

Any image file you want to animate with Animaniac must have an associated config file.
By default, we look for the image file with its suffix replaced by "cfg", eg:
  etc/sprites.png => etc/sprites.cfg
  
File is processed linewise.
Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped, empty lines ignored, then the first char tells us what to do:
  #  Comment, ignore line. NB comments are full-line only.
  [  Begin a new face.
  =  Set face parameter (applying to all frames).
  -  Define a frame.
  
[FACE_NAME]
  Trailing ']' is technically optional.
  Only G0 bytes are accepted (0x20..0x7e).
  We enforce an arbitrary length limit of 64 bytes.
  Everything below this line, to the next "[]" line, constitutes one face.
  
= KEY VALUE...
  rate
    VALUE ends either "hz", "ms", or "f".
    Timing is always quantized to 60hz frames; we'll match your value best effort.
  size W H
    Size of all frames in pixels, in case some are smaller than others.
    If you declare any frame larger than this, it's an error.
    If you do not declare a size, we implicitly use the largest frame.
  anchor NW|N|NE|W|CTR|E|SW|S|SE
    Where to attach frames smaller than the "size" box.
    Default CTR.
    
- X Y W H DURATION ANCHOR
  Define a frame.
  (X,Y) are required. Top-left corner of the image in pixels.
  (W,H) may be omitted if the face has a shared "size".
  (DURATION) requires a unit suffix, eg: 32ms = 2f = 30hz. May omit if shared "rate".
  (ANCHOR) optional, overrides face's default.
